          Media Design Practices (MDP) at ArtCenter is an interdisciplinary graduate program that allows me to explore the intersections of art, design, technology, research, and social impact.
        </p>

        <p class="mdp-intro-paragraph">
          Coming from a studio art background, I initially felt unsure. But soon, I realized that MDP is not only challenging — it’s also deeply inclusive. I brought in my own lens — thinking as someone who paints, observes, and senses.
        </p>

        <p class="mdp-intro-paragraph">
          Over the past year, I’ve made projects that visualize coffee memories, contributed to the design of two apps, explored alternative typography systems, created an interactive Getty card game, experimented with multi-modal information expression, and expanded my understanding of technology through making.
        </p>

        <p class="mdp-intro-paragraph">
          These works reflect my ongoing interest in crossing mediums, engaging tools critically, and expressing emotion through form.

          <p class="works-paragraph">
            This project aims to transform everyday coffee experiences into 
            <strong>visible and shareable data expressions</strong>. Using P5.js and HTML, I developed an interactive 
            web tool that allows users to input details of their coffee moment—such as volume, flavor direction, 
            drinking time, and mood—and generate a unique visual pattern for each cup. You can try it 
            <a href="https://irisxu10.github.io/XXU_Artcenter/Dev4_Coffee/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="works-paragraph">
            These visuals were later <strong>translated into physical forms</strong> by printing them on transparent 
            sticker paper and mounting them onto acrylic sheets. Each acrylic piece was paired with a 
            hand-splattered coffee canvas, creating a layered and textured record of both data and feeling.
          </p>
          <p class="works-paragraph">
            This project is not just about taste—it’s about <strong>memory, emotion, and habit</strong>.  
            Each coffee moment is no longer just consumed, but <strong>seen, saved, and shared</strong>.

            <p class="work-subtitle"><strong>A playful card-based system for exploring art in large museum spaces.</strong></p>

            <p class="works-paragraph">
              This project began with on-site observation at the Getty Museum, where I noticed that many visitors—especially first-timers—felt lost or overwhelmed by the scale of the space and the lack of clear entry points. 
              I saw how people often turned to the information desk to ask what they should see, or which artworks were the most famous.
            </p>
            <p class="works-paragraph">
              Inspired by this, I designed a set of game-like cards that encourage <strong>spontaneous exploration and discovery</strong>. The deck includes artwork cards, gallery zone cards, and interactive missions—each crafted to help visitors notice, learn, and play as they move through the space.
            </p>
            <p class="works-paragraph">
              Some cards feature well-known pieces, while others spotlight overlooked gems. Together, they offer an <strong>alternative wayfinding system</strong> that goes beyond maps and labels—fostering engagement, curiosity, and connection.
            </p>
            <p class="works-paragraph">
              “ArtQuest” transforms a museum visit from passive viewing into <strong>active adventure</strong>. Whether played solo or with others, it’s an invitation to wander, wonder, and see differently.

            <p class="works-paragraph">
              In this project, I experimented with <strong>Long Exposure photography</strong> as a self-portrait method. Using a technique similar to playing “freeze tag,” I alternated between <em>10 seconds of motion in darkness</em> and <em>10 seconds of stillness under light</em>—allowing multiple versions of myself to appear in one frame.
            </p>
            <p class="works-paragraph">
              A small light source was added to trace my movements, creating layered images where time and body intertwine. It’s not just a photo—it’s a quiet study of how we shift, repeat, and exist across moments.

              Inspired by the story of cats returning to ‘Meow Star,’ this project reimagines a writing system created by feline elders trying to reconnect with humans. Each letter mimics the trace of a cat’s claw, written from top to bottom—just as cats scratch. Blue was chosen because it’s one of the few colors cats can perceive.
