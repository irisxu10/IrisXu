      <h2>Hello — I’m Iris Xiaomeng Xu</h2>
      <p>I’m Iris, a designer and artist from Beijing, currently based in Los Angeles.

I’m pursuing an MFA in Media Design Practices at ArtCenter College of Design, where I explore the intersections of art, design, and technology—especially how interaction, systems, and media can become tools for reflection and relation. With a background in Studio Art and Graphic Design, I’ve always worked through visual language and material form.

Rather than stepping away from art, I see my current practice as an expansion of it—one that brings artistic thinking into dialogue with design methods, emerging technologies, and critical research.
My goal is to create work that seamlessly integrates these domains, where poetic sensibility and technical systems can coexist and inform one another.

      <h2>Where I Come From</h2>
      <p>I began in fine arts, exploring traditional media like painting, drawing, and printmaking.
Over time, I grew curious: What if the canvas expanded beyond the frame? What if design could tell stories not just through visuals, but through interaction, motion, code, and materials?
That curiosity brought me to the Media Design Practices program at ArtCenter, where I now work at the intersection of design, technology, and critical research.

      <h2>What I Care About</h2>
      <p>I care deeply about relationships—the subtle, often invisible threads that connect people, nature, technology, and the self.
I observe the world through patterns of interaction: how people relate to one another, how we engage with our environments, how tools mediate emotion, and how natural and technological systems shape our inner lives.
Design, for me, begins with attention. I grow plants and track their rhythms of unfolding; I notice how people place and use objects around them—what they keep close, what they leave untouched. I also reflect on how technologies influence emotional states, habits, and unspoken needs.
Through these observations, I attempt to engage in dialogue with environments, behaviors, and systems—and respond through form, structure, or interaction.
My goal is not to control these relationships, but to listen to them—and to make work that quietly reflects, connects, and invites.</p>
